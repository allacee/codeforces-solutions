# solutions
This repo stores my problem-solving related code

### TODO:
- improve `leetcode problem puller` and add better tests generation
- make `leetcode problem puller` actually generate tests instead of what's implemented now
- update `leetcode` directory structure and add subdirectories for every problem to store solutions and tests in the separate files
- keep grinding :)
